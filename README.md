## Overview

> Breast-cancer Diagnostic The second greatest cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer, is breast cancer, which is the most prevalent invasive cancer in females. Since 1989, significant progress has been made in the detection and treatment of breast cancer. More than 3.1 million Americans have survived breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). About 1 in 38 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime (2.6 percent ). Early detection of the disease and precise diagnosis both increase the likelihood of long-term survival for a person with breast cancer.The prognosis, or anticipated long-term behavior of the disease, heavily influences the choice of appropriate therapy immediately following surgery.

> The purpose of this project is to extract useful features by using causal inferences and building the model to predict the diagnosis.

## Data

 I extracted the data from kaggle. i downloaded and put it in my repository data folder. i was provided with a csv file with 31 features including the target variable diagnosis. Features in the data are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
